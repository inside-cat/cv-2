      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p class="about">I am an Association of Professional Piercers Member at Body Piercing by Bink,
        where I have been employed since 2013. I am passionate about beautiful jewelry and love using photography
        to showcase exquisite pieces. I also consider myself an amateur nature photographer. I am currently
        working toward becoming a competent web developer and exploring that career field when possible.</p>

        <h3 class="skills">Photography &#65372; Adobe Creative Suite &#65372; Marketing &#65372; Design</h3>
        <p class="skills">I attended Florida State University and received a Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art
          in 2015. It was there that I discovered my love of photography, and I have since sought to hone and explore
          that skill further. I use Photoshop and Lightroom extensively to edit and beautify product photos. I am also
          familiar with Illustrator and Indesign. My art background and focus on design in undergrad helps me create
          beautiful and useful projects.</p>

        <h3 class="skills mid">Web Development &#65372; HTML &#65372; CSS</h3>
        <p class="skills mid">I am still developing this skill, but am excited to learn more about the field and put my
          knowledge to use to create beautiful and functional websites and applications. Currently I can effectively use HTML
          and CSS at an intermediate level, and have some basic experience with Python. I am learning these skills by teaching
          myself and from various online resources like Udemy.com, CodeAcademy.com, Stanford University's CodeinPlace program,
          and more.</p>

        <h3 class="skills">Management &#65372; Leadership &#65372; Customer Care</h3>
        <p class="skills">I've managed a small team of employees in a local business setting for about two years. My skills
          include office, team, inventory, and sales management. My emotional intelligence, attention to detail, and
          light-hearted nature help me to create both a positive work environment for employees and enjoyable customer experiences.</p>
